Quick Start:
To Build: Run make
To Run: Execute at command line "./main"

Details:
This assignment was done using pointers, functions and dynamic memory allocation. It also shows that I understand how to use pointers and memory allocation. I wrote a C program that asks the user to enter an integer n of any size. I then generated n random numbers (between 0 and 99) and stored them in an array. After, I iterate through this array to print the unsorted values. Then, passed this array to a function that sorted the array using a sorting algorithm i chose. Upon returning to the main function, I had it print the now sorted array. Then, using the sorted array, I had it calculate the mean, median, mode, standard deviation and variance from the values in the array. Each of these statistics are calculated in a different function and returned to the main function.
