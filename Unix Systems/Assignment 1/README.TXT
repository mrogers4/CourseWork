Details:
This assignment tested my knowledge of several topics, including accepting user input, using various standard C libraries, if-statements, and types of loops. I wrote a C program that generates a random number between 0 and 99. Then, allowed the user to continue guessing the random number until they get it correct. After each guess, the program displayed to the user if their guess was either “Too high” or “Too low”. I also kept track of the number of guesses it takes for the user to guess correctly. When the user guesses the correct number, I had it display a congratulatory message and the total number of guesses, and then have it exit successfully.
