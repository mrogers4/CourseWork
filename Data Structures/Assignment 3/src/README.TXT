This program shows my understanding of a couple of diffeent topics. I made an ennumeration of cards with their specific characteristics including the value and the suite of that card. I then had it first print out a full deck of cards before anything and unshuffled. After I have it print out the deck of cards after they are shuffled. Then I deal out a specific number of cards and I have it print out the cards remaining before and after the cards are dealt out. After, the whole process is repeated again with a different number of cards dealt out.
