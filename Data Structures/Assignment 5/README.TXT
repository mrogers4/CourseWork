This assignment shows my understanding of Hash Tables. I had to read in a certain document of data that has certain users with usernames and a password. It would then print out all of those usernames and passwords. After it would ask what my username was and then the password that goes along with it. If either of them was wrong, it would say that the authentification is invalid.
